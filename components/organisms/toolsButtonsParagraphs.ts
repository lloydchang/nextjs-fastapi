        The Lazy Person's Guide to Saving the World - United Nations Sustainable Development
        End extreme poverty. Fight inequality and injustice. Fix climate change. Whoa.
        The Sustainable Development Goals are important, world-changing objectives that 
        will require cooperation among governments, international organizations, and world leaders. 
        It seems impossible that the average person can make an impact. Should you just give up?
  
        No! Change starts with you. Seriously. Every human on earth—even the most indifferent, 
        laziest person among us—is part of the solution. Fortunately, there are some super easy

  SDG Localization and the Voluntary Local Reviews | Department of Economic and Social Affairs
  Background
  When adopting the 2030 Agenda, United Nations member States committed to working closely with local and regional governments on the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Since 2015, metropolises, small cities, regions and their associations alike have been actively localizing the 2030 Agenda, bringing the SDGs closer to the people they serve and using the framework as a tool for planning and execution.
  
  As part of its follow-up and review mechanisms, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development encourages member States to "conduct regular and inclusive reviews of progress at the national and sub-national levels, which are country-led and country-driven" (paragraph 79). Paragraph 89 of the 2030 Agenda calls on major groups and other stakeholders, including local authorities, to report on their contribution to the implementation of the Agenda.
  
  In this spirit, local and regional governments are increasingly engaging in such sub-national reviews of SDG implementation, also called Voluntary Local Reviews (VLRs). While the VLRs hold no official status, the process of undertaking these sub-national reviews is providing multiple benefits to the entities engaging in them and to SDG implementation at large. These VLRs can also help to reinforce vertical coherence and complement and contribute to the national Voluntary National Reviews of SDG implementation. 
  
  The documents and reports submitted by cities and regions that are available on this website have been placed on the platform as received. The designations employed do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of the Secretariat of the United Nations concerning the legal status of any country, territory or area, or of its authorities, or concerning its frontiers or boundaries.

  Launch of the Global Sustainable Development Report 2023
  12th September, New York - The Global Sustainable Development Report 2023, prepared by the Independent Group of Scientists, was launched on Tuesday 12th September at 12:30pm EST in the UN Press Briefing Room. The report builds on the 2019 report providing evidence that can help decision-makers to accelerate action and overcome impediments that stand in the way of progress on sustainable development. The focus is on accelerating transformation through important entry points and enabling science to support this acceleration. The live broadcast of the report launch can be viewed via UN Web TV.
  
  Background
  The Global Sustainable Development Report (GSDR) is a United Nations publication aiming to strengthen the science-policy interface at the High-Level Political Forum (HLPF) on Sustainable Development, the main United Nations platform providing political leadership and guidance on sustainable development issues at the international level. It is one of the only two mandated reports to inform the decision-making process at the HLPF.
  
  The GSDR adopts an assessment-of-assessments approach, documenting and describing the landscape of information on specific issues that are policy-relevant in the field of sustainable development, bringing together dispersed information and assessments.
  The GSDR is complementary to other assessments and substantive reports being prepared by the UN system and other institutions; it draws upon contributions from a wide range of experts and stakeholders from across the world, bringing together diverse perspectives and disciplinary backgrounds.
  The GSDR is global in coverage while taking into account the perspectives of the five UN regions.
  In developing the GSDR, extensive inputs are sought from within the UN system, as well as from external experts including scientists, government officials and stakeholders at all levels, including representatives of academies of sciences and relevant expert groups.
  Building on three prototype editions of the GSDR in 2014, 2015 and 2016, in the Ministerial Declaration of the 2016 HLPF, Member States decided that the GSDR should be produced once every four years to inform the quadrennial SDG review deliberations at the High-Level Political Forum under the auspices of the General Assembly, and that it should be written by an Independent Group of Scientists (IGS) appointed by the Secretary-General. The IGS would consist of 15 experts representing a variety of backgrounds, scientific disciplines and institutions, ensuring geographical and gender balance. It would be supported by a task team of six UN entities (UN DESA, UNCTAD, UNDP, UNEP, UNESCO and the World Bank).

  THE 17 GOALS | Sustainable Development
  History
  The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are an urgent call for action by all countries - developed and developing - in a global partnership. They recognize that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth – all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests.
  
  The SDGs build on decades of work by countries and the UN, including the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs
  
  In June 1992, at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, more than 178 countries adopted Agenda 21, a comprehensive plan of action to build a global partnership for sustainable development to improve human lives and protect the environment.
  Member States unanimously adopted the Millennium Declaration at the Millennium Summit in September 2000 at UN Headquarters in New York. The Summit led to the elaboration of eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to reduce extreme poverty by 2015.
  The Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development and the Plan of Implementation, adopted at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in South Africa in 2002, reaffirmed the global community's commitments to poverty eradication and the environment, and built on Agenda 21 and the Millennium Declaration by including more emphasis on multilateral partnerships.
  At the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in June 2012, Member States adopted the outcome document "The Future We Want" in which they decided, inter alia, to launch a process to develop a set of SDGs to build upon the MDGs and to establish the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development. The Rio +20 outcome also contained other measures for implementing sustainable development, including mandates for future programmes of work in development financing, small island developing states and more.
  In 2013, the General Assembly set up a 30-member Open Working Group to develop a proposal on the SDGs.
  In January 2015, the General Assembly began the negotiation process on the post-2015 development agenda. The process culminated in the subsequent adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, with 17 SDGs at its core, at the UN Sustainable Development Summit in September 2015.
  2015 was a landmark year for multilateralism and international policy shaping, with the adoption of several major agreements:
  Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (March 2015)
  Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development (July 2015)
  Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with its 17 SDGs was adopted at the UN Sustainable Development Summit in New York in September 2015.
  Paris Agreement on Climate Change (December 2015)
  Now, the annual High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development serves as the central UN platform for the follow-up and review of the SDGs.
  Today, the Division for Sustainable Development Goals (DSDG) in the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) provides substantive support and capacity-building for the SDGs and their related thematic issues, including water, energy, climate, oceans, urbanization, transport, science and technology, the Global Sustainable Development Report (GSDR), partnerships and Small Island Developing States. DSDG plays a key role in the evaluation of UN systemwide implementation of the 2030 Agenda and on advocacy and outreach activities relating to the SDGs. In order to make the 2030 Agenda a reality, broad ownership of the SDGs must translate into a strong commitment by all stakeholders to implement the global goals. DSDG aims to help facilitate this engagement.

  Grants for Advancing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
  Team-focused grants of up to $7,500 to fund locally executed but internationally oriented multi-disciplinary programs such as lectures and workshops that highlight and enhance UC Davis’ connections to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
  Global Affairs, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, Sustainability and Grand Challenges are pleased to announce the call for grants to promote multidisciplinary collaborations focused on advancing one or more of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Grants for Advancing Sustainable Development Goals facilitate faculty engagement with economic, social, and environmental issues critical to humankind at the local, regional, national, and international levels. Addressing these complex challenges requires multidisciplinary, transdisciplinary, multi-stakeholder collaborations.
  
  The purpose of the SDG grants is to advance inclusive global dialogues and projects that contribute to the achievement of the SDGs. Grants are co-led by diverse, interdisciplinary teams of UC Davis faculty working equitably and sustainably alongside local and/or international partners. Potential partners include universities, research entities, NGOs, private sector organizations, or others who can help UC Davis further the creative exploration of how the SDGs provide a common language and platform for tackling challenges both locally and globally. Successful grants reinforce campus commitments to global collaboration, diversity, equity and inclusion principles, and social and environmental sustainability, and are grounded in directly addressing the systemic inequities at the core of the SDGs.
  
  Proposals might advance the achievement of the SDGs in different ways, including but not limited to generating innovative collaborative projects or approaches that focus on specific SDGs in a particular region of the world (e.g., in Latin America, Asia, Europe, Africa, etc.) and/or a particular SDG-oriented challenge (e.g., climate change or addressing poverty, hunger, or socioeconomic inequality); and/or the multifaceted cultural and societal contexts necessary for a holistic approach to complex problems.    
  
  Grant funding supports workshops, seminars, speaker series, knowledge sharing, trainings, or other events or activities. These can take place either on the UC Davis campus, in the community, or in other venues around the world, with UC Davis partnering as a visible, co-lead and/or organizer. Proposals for virtual, hybrid, and in-person events are welcome.
  
  Eligibility and Funds
  UC Davis Academic Senate and Academic Federation members with PI status from any UC Davis location are eligible to apply. Proposals are encouraged from diverse groups of PIs/co-leads, with the primary PI required to be UC Davis faculty. Ideally, teams will include at least one international co-lead/collaborator and will represent a range of disciplines and experiences. Including undergraduate and graduate students in grant activities is encouraged, but they may not serve as project leads.
  
  This year we expect to award up to five grants, each worth up to $7,500.
  
  Two awards are open for projects that focus on any one or more of the 17 SDGs.
  One award will go to a proposal that is clearly focused on climate change (SDG 13).
  One award will go to a proposal that is clearly focused on SDG 10.3: “Ensure equal opportunity and reduce inequalities of outcome, including by eliminating discriminatory laws, policies, and practices and promoting appropriate legislation, policies, and action in this regard.”
  One award will be reserved for CAMPOS/CAMPSSAH scholars
  CAMPOS and CAMPSSAH aim to encompass the multicultural perspectives of academic faculty in STEM as well as social science, arts, and humanities, focusing on expanding the presence of women and underrepresented faculty in those disciplines.

  SDG Financing | Joint SDG Fund
  JOINT PROGRAMME PROFILES
  SDG Finance - Enabling Environment
  SDG Finance - Catalytic Investment
  Transforming our world
  By accelerating progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals and 2030 Agenda means getting the right economic, social and environmental policies in place and taking them to scale as quickly as possible.
  The Joint Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Fund is an innovative instrument to incentivize the transformative policy shifts and stimulate the strategic investments required to get the world back on track to meet the SDGs. The UN Secretary-General sees the Joint SDG Fund as a key part of the reform of the UN’s development work by providing the “muscle” for a new generation of Resident Coordinators (RCs) and UN Country Teams (UNCTs) to really accelerate SDG implementation.
  
  To date it has funded 230 joint programmes focused on integrated social protection or SDG finance, it has stimulated over 1,000+ partnerships working together alongside the UN to support the SDGs and it has tested over 300 innovative solutions to accelerate the 2030 Agenda.
  
  The Joint SDG Fund is a multi-partner trust fund. This means contributions it receives are not entity-specific, but aim to support broader UN system-level functions. In this way, it differs from restrictive earmarked funding which can fuel competition and hamper cooperation among UN entities. This type of pooled funding used by multi-partners trust funds, like the Joint SDG Fund is widely considered ‘multilateralism-friendly’ – and is much more suitable for the integrated support at scale essential for achieving the 2030 Agenda.  Flexibility in reallocating funds has also proven critical for rapid responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.
  
  With a total of US$ 250 million for 3 years, the Joint SDG Fund is still far short of the annual US$ 290 million target envisioned by the UN Secretary-General and agreed to the Fund's Funding Compact. If substantively capitalised, the Joint SDG Fund can become a transformational instrument for the United Nations as it helps the world achieve the SDGs in COVID-19 times.
  
   
  
  What Makes the Joint SDG Fund Special?
  If the world is to “build back better” toward a much more sustainable, just and equitable world – and get on a trajectory to achieve the SDGs – we need to get the right economic, social and environmental policies in place and mobilize the financing required to bring those policies to scale as soon as possible. Big picture – this is why the Joint SDG Fund is so important.
  
  Stimulating shifts in the uptake of integrated and transformative policies can lead to the creation of smart financing strategies that put SDG progress into high gear at global, regional, and country levels. The programmes we support are all nationally owned and led, each built on a country’s unique United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDG).
  
  If we want to Leave No One Behind we have to fast track SDG gains while mainstreaming issues related to human rights, gender, youth, the environment, and people living with disabilities. The Joint SDG Fund aims to inspire a shift in the way we “do development” by placing the focus on integrated policy, strategic investments and financing, and robust partnerships. We incentivize partners to adopt strategic financing and integrated policy solutions because smarter, collective investments can accelerate the SDGs.

  SDG Data Catalog - AI for Good Foundation
  An open, extensible, global database of data sets relevant to the Sustainable Development Goals.
  An open, evolving global database of SDG relevant data sets.
  The SDG Data Catalog is an open, extensible, global database of data sets, metadata, and research networks built automatically by mining millions of published open access academic works.
  
  The SDG Data Catalog leverages advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies to extract and organize knowledge from public datasets that is otherwise hidden in plain sight in the continuous stream of research generated by the scientific community.
  
  The goal, ultimately, is to connect researchers and students with SDG-relevant datasets so that their work can make meaningful progress towards social good.

  Localizing the SDGs
  Discover Tools
  Identify areas relevant to your territory, community, political agenda or project and discover tools that can be tailored to your needs. The tools can be adapted to different settings, contexts and development challenges.
  
  introducing: the toolboxpurposewhat is localization?
  Flexible. Simple. Yet Concrete.
  
  This Toolbox does not hold rigid guides, nor one-size-fits-all solutions. Instead, it has practical, adaptable mechanisms and instruments, which address various development challenges. The resources empower local actors and help you channel global goals into local actions.
  
  The search for the most appropriate tools and strategies for ‘localizing’ the SDGs is critical to the design, implementation, review and success of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The tools you find here may be employed in heterogeneous and complex settings, where political, institutional, economic and social characteristics differ — not only between countries, but between territories of the same country, or even within parts of a specific territory. These guides are developed considering a wide variety of regional experiences, with different stakeholders strengthening them with inputs.
  
  Our focus is to be simple, providing applicable guidance in changing environments. It is also to remain flexible, yet concrete. We work to provide practical direction in assessing, planning, implementing and monitoring local policies, in accordance with the Sustainable Development Goals’ attainment strategies.
